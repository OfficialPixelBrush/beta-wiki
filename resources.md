# Resources
Further reading and sources for things. Definitely useful if you'd like to learn more about the topics laid out here, and how these infos were uncovered in the first place.

Some stuff can be found on the [BetrockServer Wiki](https://github.com/OfficialPixelBrush/BetrockServer/wiki). It also features a very complete [ID Listing](https://github.com/OfficialPixelBrush/BetrockServer/wiki/Full-ID-Listing),
though the one hosted on [grahamedgecombe.com](https://minecraft-ids.grahamedgecombe.com/) is a great alternative for general usage, although it may contain blocks that did not exist until a future version.
