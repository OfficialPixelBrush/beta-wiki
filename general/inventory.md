# Inventory
{: .no_toc }
Inventories/Windows behave quite differently to how one'd expect. On the network side the slots tend to be counted from the one that's top-left down to the one that's bottom-right. Due to how the player inventory is counted and stored, some conversion is necessary, depending on which inventory is open and what slot was clicked.

Each inventory/window also has a unique identifier/index.

{: .note }
> For the NBT-side, repeated numbers do not mean that slots are shared. Separate inventories count their slots independently.

1. TOC
{:toc}

## Player
The player inventory has no index. It has a few obvious oddities between how its sent over the network and how its stored, namely the armor slots starting at index 100 and being ordered bottom to top.

{: .note }
> The items in the crafting grid appear to not have a slot associated with them when saved or loaded to NBT.

## Chest (0)
Chests have an index of `0`.

Large Chests are just normal chests that happen to be adjacent when opened. They do not share a tile entity entry, and as such count/store their slots separately.

It appears the chest that is visually to the left represents the upper half of the large chest, while the right represents the lower half.

## Crafting Table (1)
Crafting Tables have an index of `1`.

> Crafting Tables are not tile entities and store no NBT data!

## Furnace (2)
Furnaces have an index of `2`.

## Dispenser (3)
Dispensers have an index of `3`.

## Outside (-999)
This is not any valid inventory. If the number `-999` is sent over the network, it means the player has clicked outside of an open inventory/window.
