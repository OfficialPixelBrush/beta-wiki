| `0x22`    | Clientbound      |


## Clientbound
Sent to the client to set an entity's position absolutely. Usually sent when an entity moves more than 4 blocks, as the position data is in [entity space](../terminology#entity-space). Rotation data is also quantized.

| Field  | Type   | Description                  |
| ------ | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| Entity ID | Integer | The ID of the entity that should be moved |
| X      | Integer | The X position of the player (Quantized) |
| Y      | Integer | The Y position of the player (Quantized) |
| Z      | Integer | The Z position of the player (Quantized) |
| Yaw | Byte | Rotation on the X Axis (Quantized) |
| Pitch | Byte | Rotation on the Y Axis (Quantized) |
