## Additional Data
Some of these effects also have additional metadata available as an integer in the [Effect packet](packets/061-effect).
- `MUSIC_DISC` - `0` to stop playing music, `2256` for 13 and `2257` for "Cat".
- `SMOKE` - TODO: This supposedly denotes the direction of the smoke.
- `BLOCK_BREAK`: The block id of the block that's been broken. Sets the sound for whats appropriate and spawns particles with the relevant texture
