# Blocks
{: .no_toc }
Blocks do a lot in Minecraft, given that it's a voxel-based world. In most cases, when a block is placed or mined, the server needs to reply with a [block change packet](../packets/053-block-change).

If this packet isn't sent, the client just assumes the packet was dropped or the client wasn't allowed to place the block, replacing it with air after a second or two.
