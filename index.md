# Beta Wiki
A wiki documenting Minecraft Beta 1.7.3's technical specification and network protocol.
![](../banner.jpg)

## Objective
To consolidate all knowledge on Minecrafts Legacy Protocols, specifically the way they were by Beta 1.7.3. This includes documenting both client and server behavior and communications, all while explaining it in such a way that anyone can make their own client or server with relative ease.
