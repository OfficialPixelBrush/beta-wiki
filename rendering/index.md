# Rendering
This section is more relevant for clients than servers, though stuff like lighting is usually calculated on the server-side as well.

## Basis
Minecraft, up until [Java Edition RC1](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_RC1), used OpenGL 1.1 via LWJGL.

As a result it is constrained to OpenGL 1.1s fixed-function pipeline.
