# Textures
Textures are what give each rendered block their colorful, detailed appearance.

## Texture Atlas
The texture atlas contains all possible block textures in the game, and is 256x256 in the Vanilla game. Each block shares its textures with every other block, only having a unique appearance by zooming into and showing different parts of the atlas by using differing UV-Coordinates.
