## Legality of the Project

The wiki, in its attempt to document Beta 1.7.3 as closely and accurately as possible, has made and will continue to make use of decompiled code, which is derivative of the original .jar binary file that Mojang provides.

Some pages still contain snippets of info or pseudocode that closely resemble the decompiled source code they're based on. These should be rewritten sooner or later to avoid any trouble for anyone who wants to make a fully FOSS reimplementation of the Beta 1.7.3 spec.

## What parts are safe?

Most parts of the wiki were written with no insight into the decompiled code, and are thus perfectly safe for any FOSS projects.

The following is a list of pages that were created while directly referencing the decompiled Beta 1.7.3 code, and thus may cause issues if any pseudocode on them is directly referenced and implemented.

- [Worlds/Biomes](./worlds/biomes)
- [Worlds/Generation](./worlds/generation)
- [Worlds/Population](./worlds/population)
- [Worlds/Map Item](./worlds/mapItem)
- [Redstone](./redstone/components)

All other pages were either based on already public knowledge, i.e. things that were documented on the Minecraft Wiki or the wiki.vg Archive, done through Black box reverse engineering or simply explaining it in a way that seems obvious.
